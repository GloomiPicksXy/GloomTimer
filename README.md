# GloomTimer for Ro-Ball Games
For the time being this is probably the worse projects I've ever got into.
basically this just autotimes for you for specific ro-ball games such as [Hoop-Nation](https://www.roblox.com/games/15558033314/MASCOTS-Hoop-Nation#ropro-quick-search) Between 500-510MS if you want to green all the time.
And [Highschool-Hoop](https://www.roblox.com/games/13876564679/Highschool-Hoops-Demo-Stress-Test#ropro-quick-search) 430 for shooting ***E*** and 330 for Layup ***Q**

##

## Reminder
* some ro-ball games have different shooting mechanics some depends on the ping
* so it's better to find the best MS for the game you want for example [Hoop nation 500ms]
