# GloomTimer for Ro-Ball Games
For the time being this is probably the worse projects I've ever got into.
basically this just autotimes for you for specific ro-ball games such as [Hoop-Nation](https://www.roblox.com/games/15558033314/MASCOTS-Hoop-Nation#ropro-quick-search) Between 500-510MS if you want to green all the time.
And [Highschool-Hoop](https://www.roblox.com/games/13876564679/Highschool-Hoops-Demo-Stress-Test#ropro-quick-search) 430 for shooting ***E*** and 330 for Layup **Q**

# How to use this [Just in-case you don't know]
> Note: You should `Install` the `latest version`
1. Install [PYTHON](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Is open CMD `[Command Prompt]` And type
```python
pip install customtkinter
```
```python
pip install keyboard
```
4. Run the timer.py

# Reminder
* some ro-ball games have different shooting mechanics some depends on the ping
* so it's better to find the best MS for the game you want for example [Hoop nation 500ms]

# Disclaimer
I WILL NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY IF YOU EVER GET BANNED IN-GAME `well probably not cause this is undetected ðŸ’€`
AND ALSO I DONNOT CARE IF YOU ***SKID** THIS LMFAO
